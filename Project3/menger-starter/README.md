Assignment 3 Progress Report
Group: Srikanth Nemana, Nour Hajjar, Preeth Kanamangala.
We have been working through MengerSpong.ts. So far we have worked on implementing the sponge generation code; we have become familiar with the codebase and we have implemented 
the menger sponge generation code in MengerSponge.ts. We are having some issues with rendering but that is because we have not gotten around to implementing Camera Controls yet.
We have worked on these features in a pair programming implementation. We plan on finishing up our Menger Sponge implementation this weekend. We anticipate making more substantial
progress next week as many of us had exams this week.
